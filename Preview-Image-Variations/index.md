# Metadata and Preview Image Variations

### Goal of the Assignment

The goal of this assignment was to create and test different versions of metadata and preview images for a type specimen. I wanted everything to be clear, easy to read, and work well across different platforms and audiences.  

The task also pushed me to write short, simple text and make preview images that stay legible and look good at any size or crop.

### Metadata Variations

As part of the assignment, three different metadata variations were created. Each variation includes a title, description, and alt text for my [Bespoke character](https://vittek444.github.io/english-for-designers/bespoke-character/)

**Description:** A reflection connecting the ritual of making toast with graphic design about balance, timing, and thoughtful attention.  
**Alt Text:** Lower case “t” cut out of cheese on a piece of toast in a block of text about morning ritual and desing.  

2. **Title:** Finding Balance in Bread and Design  
**Description:** A creative link between toasting bread and graphic design, showing how care and small details shape beautiful results.  
**Alt Text:**  Golden-brown toast topped with a cheese cutout shaped like a lowercase “t” in a block of text about morning ritual and desing.

3. **Title:** Small Rituals, Big Design Lessons  
**Description:** A story comparing making toast to graphic design, where precision, balance, and patience bring harmony.  
**Alt Text:**  A perfectly toasted slice with a cheese “t” cutout in a block of text about morning ritual and desing.
