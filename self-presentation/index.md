# Self-presentation
I have created a short presentation of my design works.
In the presentation, I introduce myself and highlight three outstanding projects that I am most proud of.
The focus is on clarity, legibility, and a confident visual presentation, serving as a warm-up for a larger project ahead.

![Opening slide to my self-presentation.](Frame 1.jpg)  
*This opening slide sets the tone for the presentation. 
I briefly introduce myself and explain the course, date, and goal before moving on to the projects.*  

![Slide teasing about that Im gonna be talking about 3 of my projects.](Frame 2.jpg)  
*This slide hints that I’ll present three projects.  
The triangle stands for balance and stability.  
The numbers 1, 2, and 3 point to each project, while the symbol in the center shows that all three are equally important.*  

![1st project Frankfurt Book fair 2026 a quick itroduction with mockup of one of my poster designs.](Frame 4.jpg)  
*Here I introduce my first project, a design concept for the Czech Republic as Guest of Honor at the Frankfurt Book Fair 2026.  
The project is based on the theme “Czechia – A Land on the Coast” and uses metaphor and storytelling.*  

![Showcase of my poster design orange and purple color variants, the typograpghy and 3D elements.](Frame 5.jpg)  
*I wanted the visual identity to feel simple and clear, but still expressive.  
I focused on typography, color, and subtle 3D elements to keep the design clean and engaging.*

*This bookmark mockup shows how the visual identity could work on small printed items.*

*This billboard mockup shows how the same visual style works at a large outdoor scale.*  

![2nd project Theater poster a quick introduction and mockup of it.](Frame 12.jpg)  
*My second project is a theatre poster made using only hand-made techniques.  
I chose an Art Nouveau style and based the illustration on a performer from the play, who is also my friend.*    

![Two sketches of the poster depicitng 2 girls in Art Noveau style and the name of the game, Clauds by Aristophanes.](Frame 13.jpg)  
*These are my early sketches, where I explored composition, illustration, and typography.*

*TThis slide shows the final version of the theatre poster.*  

![3rd project Mobile App for National gallery of prague with itroduction.](Frame 8.jpg)  
*My third project is a mobile app for the National Gallery Prague.  
I designed it as a simple and user-friendly guide for gallery visitors.*   

![Design showcase about homepage, scan page, tickets page and contact page.](Frame 9.jpg)  
*This slide shows my design process and the final interface.  
I worked on user research, the app structure, and an interactive prototype in Figma.  
The app focuses on clarity, ease of use, and accessibility.  
It has four main sections: **Home, Scan, Tickets, and Profile.***

- ***Home** – shows current exhibitions, selected artworks, educational content, and contact details.*

- ***Scan** – lets users scan artworks in the gallery to see more information, with tips on how to scan correctly.*

- ***Tickets** – allows users to buy tickets online quickly and easily.*

- ***Profile** – lets users customize their profile, view tickets with QR codes, and see scanned artworks.*  

![Mockup showing educational part of my app.](Frame 10.jpg)  
*This mockup shows the educational section, where users can learn about art styles and movements through well-known artworks.*  

![Mockup showing contact part of my app.](Frame 11.jpg)  
*Here we can see the contact section with opening hours, information about gallery branches in Prague, and a map.*    

![Thank you for your attention slide. Final one.](Frame 15.jpg)

Summarizing the three projects and thanks the audience for their attention.
