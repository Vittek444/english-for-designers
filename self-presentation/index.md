# Self-presentation
I have created a short presentation of my design works.
In the presentation, I introduce myself and highlight three outstanding projects that I am most proud of.
The focus is on clarity, legibility, and a confident visual presentation, serving as a warm-up for a larger project ahead.

*This slide introduces the second project, a theatre poster.
The assignment required the use of only hand-made techniques and I decided to draw it in Art Nouveau style.
The poster features a performer from the play, who is also my friend, creating a personal connection to the project.*

The goal was to design a modern and user-friendly digital guide for gallery visitors.
The application helps users navigate through exhibitions and access relevant information.*

*Description of the design process of the mobile application.
The project included user research, defining the logical structure of the app, and creating an interactive prototype in Figma.
The design focuses on clarity, usability, and accessibility for a wide range of users and mockups of the design itself.
My application is divided into four main sections: **Home page, Scan, Tickets, and the user’s personal profile.**  
On the **Home page**, users can find information about current exhibitions, selected significant artworks from ongoing exhibitions, an educational section, and contact information.  
**The Scan section** allows users to scan an artwork in the gallery to access detailed information about the piece.
This section also explains how to correctly scan the artwork to ensure accurate results.
**Tickets section** that allows users to purchase tickets online in a quick and convenient way.  
**The user profile section** allows users to set a profile picture and a background image.
It includes an overview of purchased tickets with their QR codes, a history of scanned artworks, and contact information.*

The presentation highlights my design approach, creativity, and ability to work across different media and formats.*
