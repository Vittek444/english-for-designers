# Business card 💼📇

This project is a rework of my business card created as part of a class assignment. 
The task was to translate a visual sketch into a written handshake, short introduction or tagline that clearly communicates who I am, what I do, what I’m like, and how to contact me. 
The focus was on clarity, conciseness, and readability.

My business card from class

This was my first attempt, where I played with my initials to create an interesting composition.

My second try

I used my initials as a logo on the front of the business card.

I feel much better about this one, the composition is cleaner and more confident.
