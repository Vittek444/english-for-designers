# Design a Bespoke Character

For out first assignment I created my own original letterform based on a character from the modern English alphabet. 

I selected a single letter and reimagined it through a specific style. I chose the lowercase “t” in Times New Roman, which I manually recreated by cutting the letterform out of a slice of cheese and placing it on a toasted piece of bread. My piece was made using mixed techniques, without any AI tools, focusing purely on my own craft and interpretation. The final result is a unique character that reflects my personal visual approach.
