# Alt Text

I completed this alt text exercise by exploring both personal and AI-assisted approaches. 
I first wrote two original alt text descriptions without any AI tools and one more emotional. Next, I generated few alt text descriptions using AI (ChatGPT).



#### My versions

- Lowercase "t" cutout from cheese on a slice of toasted bread.
- A piece of golden-brown toasted bread with a creative touch, a lowercase "t" cut out of cheese on top.

#### Ai versions
- A slice of toasted bread with a cheese cutout shaped like a lowercase “t” placed neatly on top.
- A warm slice of golden toast, topped with a playful cheese cutout shaped like a lowercase “t,” evoking comfort and whimsy.
- A cozy slice of golden toast with a cheese “t” on top, blending warmth and creativity in a simple breakfast moment.
- Crispy toast crowned with a playful cheese cutout shaped like a lowercase “t,” adding a touch of charm to the morning.

I wrote a short original text (around 125–250 words) exploring my perspective on craft & design. Then I developed a typographic layout featuring my bespoke drop cap, carefully balancing the letterform with the body, ensuring hierarchy, readability, line flow, and ample white space. The composition was created in InDesign, combining thoughtful content with intentional visual design.

## The Art of Toasting
A reflection connecting the ritual of making toast with graphic design about balance, timing, and thoughtful attention.

### My second creative concept
Here, I aimed to make the piece more visually engaging by adding illustrations, background color, and text color, enhancing the interaction between the drop cap and the text.
