# Business card 💼📇

This project is a rework of my business card created as part of a class assignment. 
The task was to translate a visual sketch into a written handshake, short introduction or tagline that clearly communicates who I am, what I do, what I’m like, and how to contact me. 
The focus was on clarity, conciseness, and readability.
