# This is me 👼🌟
Hii, I’m Vít Roček, a graphic designer focused on branding,UX/UI & digital art!  
I create visual systems and digital experiences that are clear, intuitive, and quietly expressive. My strength lies in turning complexity into something simple and making it feel good to use.

My design journey began in high school, where I learned to think critically about form, function, and user experience. Since then, I’ve grown through real projects, collaborations, and continuous learning design at university.

A defining moment for me was designing the visual identity for the 40th edition of Famufest with the theme of “Networks.” It was our very first assignment at university, and our project made it to the finals and was even presented to the festival’s official jury. Although our design didn’t win, the school decided to showcase it at the university exhibition on Náplavka. This experience showed me how design can reach a real audience and reinforced my passion for creating work that is thoughtful, engaging, and meaningful.

Today, I aim to craft work that balances clarity with personality. I enjoy building identities that feel alive, interfaces that feel effortless, and digital art that brings emotion into the visual space. I’m drawn to projects that challenge me to think deeper, experiment further, and create solutions that genuinely help people.

My long-term goal is to work on projects that blend culture, technology, and storytelling – design that isn’t just seen, but felt.
