# This is me 👼🌟
Hii, I’m Vít Roček, a graphic designer focused on branding,UX/UI & digital art!  
I create visual systems and digital experiences that are clear, intuitive, and quietly expressive. My strength lies in turning complexity into something simple and making it feel good to use.

My design journey began in high school, where I learned to think critically about form, function, and user experience. Since then, I’ve grown through real projects, collaborations, and continuous learning design at university.

A defining moment for me was designing an app concept for the National Gallery Prague. What started as a school project quickly became something I cared about on a deeper level. I spent weeks refining the user flow, testing interactions, and making sure every screen felt intuitive and welcoming. When I finished, I decided to send the final prototype to the Gallery itself. That experience showed me how design can move beyond the classroom and into real cultural spaces – and it reinforced how much I enjoy building digital tools that feel meaningful and accessible.

Today, I aim to craft work that balances clarity with personality. I enjoy building identities that feel alive, interfaces that feel effortless, and digital art that brings emotion into the visual space. I’m drawn to projects that challenge me to think deeper, experiment further, and create solutions that genuinely help people.

My long-term goal is to work on projects that blend culture, technology, and storytelling – design that isn’t just seen, but felt.
